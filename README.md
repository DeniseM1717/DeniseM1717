Hi, I am Denise Martinez and I attend California State University Long Beach as a Computer Science major.
I believe I can provide a very unique perspective in the male-dominated computer science field as a first gen, latinx individual. The LGBTQIA+ community is a vital part of who I am so I hope I can use my struggles and experiences to bring representation to my communities.
