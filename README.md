Hi, I am Denise Martinez and I'm a first-generation transfer student at the University of Southern California studying Computer Science and Business Administration.
I believe I can provide a very unique perspective in the male-dominated field as a first gen, latinx individual. The LGBTQIA+ community is also a vital part of who I am so I hope I can use my struggles and experiences to bring representation to my communities.
